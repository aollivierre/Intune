1- do use sysnative or system32 in the install/uninstall commands of Power Shell ?
2- should we use sysnative all of the time or only in specific cases?
3- we should be using custom detection scripts instead of rules because they are advanced and cover a wider area of cases
4- should we be using exit or no exit in detection scripts ?
5- should we be using write-host or write-output in detetion scripts ?
6- is it better to use PSADT during W32 app deployment or just native exe/msi with some power shell scripts in the install/uninstall section ?
7- should we always include requirement scripts to check for scripts ?
