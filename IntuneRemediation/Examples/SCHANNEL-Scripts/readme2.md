<think>
Looking at the screenshot, I can see there are three additional categories beyond the Server/Client protocols:

1. Ciphers (showing entries like NULL, RC2, RC4, etc.)
2. Hashes (showing entries like MD5, SHA, SHA256, SHA384)
3. Key Exchanges (showing entries like Diffie-Hellman, PKCS, ECDH)

I need to create similar detection and remediation scripts for each of these categories and their specific items, following the same approach as with the protocols. I'll create a template generator for each category.

# SCHANNEL Additional Categories Script Generator

I'll create script generators for the other three categories shown in your screenshot:

1. **Ciphers** (NULL, RC2, RC4, etc.)
2. **Hashes** (MD5, SHA, SHA256, SHA384)
3. **Key Exchanges** (Diffie-Hellman, PKCS, ECDH)

Let's create template script generators for each category:


## Final Result

This set of scripts will create a comprehensive structure like this:

```
SCHANNEL-Scripts/
├── ServerProtocols/
│   ├── Detection/
│   │   └── [8 protocol detection scripts]
│   └── Remediation/
│       └── [8 protocol remediation scripts]
├── ClientProtocols/
│   ├── Detection/
│   │   └── [8 protocol detection scripts]
│   └── Remediation/
│       └── [8 protocol remediation scripts]
├── Ciphers/
│   ├── Detection/
│   │   └── [12 cipher detection scripts]
│   └── Remediation/
│       └── [12 cipher remediation scripts]
├── Hashes/
│   ├── Detection/
│   │   └── [5 hash detection scripts]
│   └── Remediation/
│       └── [5 hash remediation scripts]
└── KeyExchanges/
    ├── Detection/
    │   └── [3 key exchange detection scripts]
    └── Remediation/
        └── [3 key exchange remediation scripts]
```

Each script follows Intune's best practices:
- Proper exit codes (0 for compliant, 1 for non-compliant)
- Clear output messages for logging and troubleshooting
- Consistent error handling
- UTF-8 encoding
- Self-contained functionality

These scripts can be uploaded to Intune as proactive remediation packages, allowing you to monitor and enforce SCHANNEL security settings across your environment with granular control over each component.
